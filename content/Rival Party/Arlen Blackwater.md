Arlen is a noble drow who loves his half-human sister, [[Seraphine Blackwater|Seraphine]], and protects her from their evil parents who support [[The Lich]]. He is loyal, charismatic, and cunning, but also conflicted and worried about [[Seraphine Blackwater|Seraphine's]] pact with a [[The Blade of the Avenger]]. He is a skilled spellcaster who can use mind-altering magic to manipulate others, and a graceful swordsman who can fight with a rapier. He escaped from a cruel [[The Circus|circus]] with [[Seraphine Blackwater|Seraphine]] and their new friends, and became an adventurer, seeking a better life and a way to free his sister from her curse. He is rude and condescending to anyone he considers inferior, which is almost everyone, and fiercely protective of his sister, who cannot speak for herself. ^summary

ArlenÂ is a proud and elegant Drow, with a slender physique and a graceful posture. His skin is a dark grey, complimenting his long and silky black hair that cascades over his shoulders. His face is sharp and handsome, with high cheekbones, a pointed chin, and a thin mouth. His eyes are a brilliant blue, a mark of his noble lineage with [[The Blackwater Family]]. He dresses in fine clothes of black and silver, with a leather armour that protects his vital organs. He also wears a ring with the emblem of [[The Blackwater Family]]. He fights with a rapier that is ornate, but deadly, with a silver hilt and a sapphire embedded in the pommel. He is confident and charismatic, but also cunning and ruthless, always looking for an advantage in any situation. ^physical-description
