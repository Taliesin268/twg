Bjorn is a colossal dwarf who was enslaved by a ringmaster and forced to perform feats of strength for a [[The Circus|circus]]. He is cheerful, confident, and boastful, but also kind and friendly. He has a huge hammer that he uses to smash anything that stands in his way, and can magically grow in size, making him even more imposing. He escaped from [[The Circus]] with his new friends, and became an adventurer, looking for challenges and fun. He is always dramatically spoken and enjoys showing off his might, but he is also a gentle giant who cares for his allies. ^summary

Bjorn is a colossal specimen of dwarven strength and endurance. He towers over most of his kin, standing at almost five feet tall and weighing more than two hundred pounds of pure muscle. His arms are thicker than most menâ€™s legs, and his chest is broad and hairy. His face is round and friendly, with a large nose, bushy eyebrows, and a thick black moustache that curls at the ends, giving him a jovial look that belies his fearsome strength. He has a bald spot on the top of his head, but he compensates for it by growing a long braid of hair that reaches his waist. He wears a red and white striped shirt, a pair of brown pants, and a leather belt with a metal buckle. He also has a pair of boots that are reinforced with iron plates, and a pair of gloves that are studded with spikes. He carries a huge hammer that he uses to smash anything that stood in his way, or to perform feats of strength for the amusement of others. He is always cheerful and confident, boasting about his might and challenging anyone to a contest of power. ^physical-description
