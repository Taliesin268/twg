Seraphine is a half-drow who was kidnapped by a cult and made a pact with a [[The Blade of the Avenger]], becoming a Celestial warlock. She is brave, loyal, and secretive, but also cursed and conflicted. She has a bond with her weapon, which urges her to evil and undead monsters. She can summon this magical greatsword from an extradimensional space, and use brilliant magic to pull enemies towards her or invigorate her friends. She was exiled from her home and tortured by a [[The Circus|circus]], where she met her new friends. She escaped with them and became an adventurer, hoping to find a way to break her curse and regain her voice. She has grey skin, hair, and eyes, and light blue stitches over her mouth, as a result of her curse. She hides her face behind a black cloth, and communicates with gestures or writing. ^summary

Seraphine is a half-Drow with a curvy and athletic build. Her skin is a lighter grey than [[Arlen Blackwater|Arlen’s]], and her hair is a dull grey, a result of her curse from [[The Lich]]. Her eyes are also grey, but they have a hint of blue in them, a sign of her connection to [[The Blackwater Family]]. Her face is round and cute, but she hides it behind a black cloth that covers her nose and mouth, to avoid unwanted attention. Under the cloth, she has light blue translucent stitches over her mouth, a symbol of her curse that prevents her from speaking. She wears a heavy leather armour that covers most of her body, with a black cloak and hood that conceal her shape. She also carries a pair of daggers that are simple and efficient, with black blades and leather handles. She is loyal and brave, but also secretive and cautious, always wary of the dangers that lurk in the shadows. ^physical-description
